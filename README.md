## Project Introduction:
This project  is a comprehensive exploration of the field of anomaly and fraud detection. It is developed using Python with PyOD, H2O and other commonly used data processing libraries. The project is structured meticulously, focusing on various aspects of anomaly detection, including both supervised and unsupervised methods, and it delves into different datasets to illustrate the application of these methods.

## Project Lifecycle:

Datasets EDA & Feature Engineering:

The project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on various datasets, including Credit Card Data, Financial Data, Healthcare Data, and Mortgage Default & Fraud Data. Focusing on creating new features through data insights to get prepared for further anomaly detection modeling.
- EDA & Feature Engineering - Credit Card Data
- EDA & Feature Engineering - Financial Data
- EDA & Feature Engineering - Healthcare Data
- EDA & Feature Engineering - Mortgage Default & Fraud Data

Over & Under Sampling:  

The project then moves on to techniques of Over & Under Sampling to balance the datasets.
